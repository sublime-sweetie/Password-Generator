# Password-Generator

## Description

This project will allow the user to generate a password.

Users will be allowed to choose how long the password will be and what type of characters will be used within the password.

If users do not choose at least two types of characters, they will get an error message to choose at least two types of characters.

If users choose less that 8 characters or more than 132 characters, they will get an error message that their password must be between 8 and 132 characters.
## Installation

User must have a web browser installed, and an internet connection.
